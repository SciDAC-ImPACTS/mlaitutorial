# mlaitutorial

This is material for a tutorial on machine learning presented at the SciDAC ImPACTS project meeting 2025. 

Setup
1. Log into a NERSC machine such as perlmutter in a terminal 
2. Clone this repository in your home directory.

Running
An allocation has been created at NERSC for this tutorial.
The tutorials are best run on jupyterhub at NERSC.

1. Go to jupyter.nersc.gov
2. Login using your NERSC credentials
3. Use the trn009 allocation.
    1. Go to iris.nersc.gov and check trn009 as the default account.  Then go to jupyter.nersc.gov and launch exclusive cpu or gpu
    2. Go straight to jupyter.nersc.gov and choose a configurable job and select trn009 as the account.
4. In the configurable job, choose the time as 120 minutes and 1 GPU per node.
5. Navigate to the mlaitutorial and choose a notebook to run.
